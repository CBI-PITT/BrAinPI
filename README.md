# bil-api

The goal of this project is to create a flask-based API for public access to Brain Image Library (BIL) datasets in many forms



The broader goals are for the API to provide multi-resolution image data to enable visualization of multi-terabyte datasets over the internet.  This will first be implemented in Napari, but can be used used by any program that can interact with the API and make use of multi-resolution series data.
